1/ **Trump approved the release of the Nunes memo after first attacking both the FBI and Justice Department in an early-morning tweet**. He accused them of having "politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats." The memo, which alleges anti-Trump bias at the FBI and DOJ, was approved for release without the redactions that the FBI and the Justice Department had lobbied for. The House Intelligence Committee then [made the memo public](http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IG/IG00/20180129/106822/HMTG-115-IG00-20180129-SD001.pdf). Trump told reporters, "I think it's a disgrace what's happening in our country... A lot of people should be ashamed of themselves and much worse than that."

* **Sean Hannity has been advising Trump on the memo all week**. Trump reportedly had several phone calls with Hannity over the last few weeks, reinforcing Trump's determination to release the memo to the public.

* **Comey praised the FBI for speaking up against "weasels and liars"** in a tweet as it relates to the Nunes memo. He called on more leaders in the government to do the same.

2/ **Yesterday, Paul Ryan said the memo is not "an indictment of the FBI, of the Department of Justice"** and that he supports the release of the Democrats memo, which counters the GOP memo. Republican leaders in Congress have been arguing that the release of the memo reveals mistakes and bias at the FBI â€“ not Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation set up by the Justice Department. Trump undermined that argument with his tweet saying the memo would prove political bias at the FBI and Justice Department.

3/ **Two attorneys representing clients caught up in Robert Mueller's probe believe Mueller could indict Trump for obstruction of justice**. Many legal experts don't believe Mueller has the standing to bring criminal charges against Trump, however. Neither attorney had specific knowledge of Mueller's plans, but suggested that he could try to bring an indictment against Trump if only to illustrate the gravity of his findings.

4/ **CIA Director Mike Pompeo met with the head of Russia's foreign intelligence agency**, even though the head of the GRU was barred from entering the US under sanctions put in place in 2014. Pompeo defended the meeting and claimed that he and other officials only met with the Russian operatives "to keep Americans safe." The Russian Embassy in Washington announced the meeting with Pompeo in a tweet on January 30th. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/01/politics/pompeo-russian-spies-meeting/index.html))

5/ **The White House wants to see more options for a military strike against North Korea**, and is frustrated by what they consider to be the Pentagon's unwillingness to provide them. The national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, believes threats are only credible if they are backed by well-developed military plans, but sources say the Pentagon is worried that the White House is too eager to use military action against the Korean Peninsula.
